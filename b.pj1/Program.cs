// You're developing a Student Grading application that automates the calculation of current grades for each student in a class. The parameters for your application are:

// You're given a short list of four students and their five assignment grades.
// Each assignment grade is expressed as an integer value, 0-100, where 100 represents 100% correct.
// Final scores are calculated as an average of the five assignment scores.
// Your application needs to perform basic math operations to calculate the final grades for each student.
// Your application needs to output/display each student’s name and final score.



// initialize variables - graded assignments
